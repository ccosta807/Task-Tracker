This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.3.

## Overview

This is a web application to track and set reminders for tasks.  The tasks contain a description, day, time, and boolean reminder value.  A user can add and delete tasks on the 
web page.  This application was developed using Angular and contains a mock db JSON server.

This project exposed me to global css styles, looping with ngFor, ngModel, header/button components, routing, and Angulars HTTP client.
